# Covid-19-Analysis-Using-Power-BI

In this Power BI Dashboard, the analysis of the impact of COVID-19 on mankind from January 22nd to July 27th, 2020, consists of two pages:
The Overview page gives us an idea of the overall changes and impacts it had on mankind and how it affected the world, whereas the Global View page gives us an idea about active cases, deaths, confirmed cases, and recovered cases in each WHO region.

Filters for WHO region, countries, and date are available on both pages for interactive analysis.

# Steps in creating a Dashboard. 

1) Importing the Excel file into Power BI.

2) Using Power Query Editor, basic data cleaning is done. This involves removing duplicate rows and columns, changing data types, replacing null values, etc.

3) Establishing relationships between the tables.

4) Creating measures.

5) Creating and customizing the dashboard with necessary details.
